/**
 * Instance methods â†’ Simulating a clock
 * You are given a class Clock. It has two int fields: hours and minutes.
 * The clock has a minute scale from 0 to 59 and an hour scale from 1 to 12.
 * The clock does not know whether it's day or night (no AM or PM).
 *
 * Add the method next that increases the value of minutes by 1.
 * The minutes must be reset to zero when the current hour ends. Do not forget to change hours as well.
 *
 * Do not make the fields and methods private.
