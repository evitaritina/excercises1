/**
 * Instance methods â†’ Car
 * You want to create a program that models the behavior of cars.
 * For this purpose, you've created a class named Car containing three fields:
 * the int field yearModel, the string field make, and the int field speed.
 *
 * You want to add functionality to your cars, so you need methods. Add the following instance methods to your class:
 *
 * accelerate that adds 5 to the speed each time it's called;
 * brake that subtracts 5 from the speed field each time it's called, the speed cannot be less than zero.
 * Do not make the fields and methods private.
