/**
 * Instance methods â†’ Complex numbers
 * Jake wants to write a program that works with complex numbers. He created a class Complex that represents a complex number with its real and imaginary parts. Now he needs instance methods so that he can calculate the sum and difference of two complex numbers.
 *
 * Help Jake and create two instance methods for his class:
 *
 * add that takes another complex number as an argument and adds its corresponding fields to the current instance;
 * subtract that takes another complex number as an argument and subtracts its corresponding fields from the current instance;
 * Both methods should return nothing.
 *
 * Do not make the fields and methods private.
