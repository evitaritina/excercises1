/**
 * The for-loop â†’ Size of parts
 * A detector compares the size of parts produced by a machine with the reference standard.
 *
 * If the size of the part is larger, it can be sent to be fixed, and the detector prints the number 1.
 * If the size of the part is smaller, it is removed as a reject, and the detector prints the number -1.
 * If the part is perfect, it is sent to the box with products, that are ready to ship, and the detector prints 0.
 *
 * Write a program, which takes the number of parts n as input, and then the sequence of detector prints.
 * The program should output numbers in a single line containing the number of parts ready to be shipped,
 * the number of parts to be fixed, and the number of rejects.
